# Overview

This document is intended to provide an opinionated approach towards the implementation security controls of Azure Database for PostgreSQL by domain. Although the approaches may not be a fit for all use cases or complete for production use,  they are meant to guide the audience towards current best practices and design considerations to achieve the security control objectives.

Azure database for PostgreSQL is available in 2 deployment options.
- Single Server
- Hyperscale (Citus) – scale horizontally across multiple nodes

Although this document largely applies to both the offerings, some of the sections have been created with single server as the focus.

## Controls and Architectures
This table maps Security Domain to the corresponding controls and architectural best practices as documented in Azure public documentation, white papers, and blog posts.

            It is recommended to enable AAD integration with PAzure Database for PostgreSQL.
            <br><br>
            Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Azure Database for PostgreSQL using identities defined in Azure AD.
            With Azure Active Directory authentication, you can manage database user identities and other Microsoft services in a central location, which simplifies permission management.
            <br><br>
            When using AAD for authentication, the security features that build in AAD can help to protect the login process. The AAD token can be obtained in various
            ways which could help to protect most of the password attach. 
            <br><br>
            Azure managed identity can be used by many Azure resources (VM, app services, Azure function, etc.) to have a controlled identity within AAD, which eliminates the need to store and
            manage any form of password or token for a deployed application. It further strenghtens the protection for authentication.
            <br><br>
            When AAD integration is not enabled, simple user/pass is used for authentication in postgres.

            <br><br>
            When setting up AAD integration for Azure postgres, an AAD account (either group or user) needs to be specified as the AAD administrator for the postgres server.
            Only the AAD users that are specified can initially connect and add more AAD user/group into postgres and assign database roles.            
            <br><br>
            Custom database roles with least privileged access is always preferable, logically grouped permissions can be used to ease the burden of administration
            <br><br>                        
            When an AAD group is added into the postgres server, any member of the group can login and assume the database role that is assigned to the group. It thus recommended to create and add 
            AAD groups only to postgres, and manage all users and role assignments using AAD, and eleminate the needs to create individual users within postgres.

        <p>
        Microsoft uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to protect data when it’s traveling between the cloud services and customers. Microsoft data-centers
        negotiate a TLS connection with client systems that connect to Azure services. TLS provides strong authentication, message privacy, and integrity (enabling
        detection of message tampering, interception, and forgery), interoperability, algorithm flexibility, and ease of deployment and use. Perfect Forward Secrecy
        (PFS) protects connections between customers’ client systems and Microsoft cloud services by unique keys. Connections also use RSA-based 2,048-bit encryption key
        lengths. This combination makes it difficult for someone to intercept and access data that is in transit. <br><br>
        All database communications from the organizations application servers to Azure PostgreSQL should use TLS1.2, Azure policy should be used to enforce encryption in transit
        on all Azure PostgreSQL servers. <br><br>
        Azure certificates should be used for the TLS process (rather than the organizations certificates) due to the gateway being common in front of all Postgres instances.

    <td class="tg-0pky">
        <p>
            Encryption at rest is required by an organization’s need for data governance and compliance efforts. Industry and government regulations such as HIPAA, PCI and
            FedRAMP, lay out specific safeguards regarding data protection and encryption requirements. All data that is stored in a cloud environment (Data at Rest) must be
            encrypted. The minimal encryption is using the native cloud functions to encrypt on data level, including virtual machines, containers and data storage.<br><br>
            Data encryption with customer-managed keys for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server enables you to bring your own key (BYOK) for data protection at rest.
            It also allows organizations to implement separation of duties in the management of keys and data. With customer-managed encryption, you are responsible for, and
            in a full control of, a key’s lifecycle, key usage permissions, and auditing of operations on keys. (Detail in BYOK/HOYK Management Section) <br><br>
            Data encryption with customer-managed keys for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server, is set at the server-level. For a given server, a customer-managed key,
            called the key encryption key (KEK), is used to encrypt the data encryption key (DEK) used by the service. The KEK is an asymmetric key stored in a customer-owned
            and customer-managed Azure Key Vault instance.

            process to protect the transfer of the key blobs, or by using Hold Your Own Key (HYOK), i.e. using HSM-protected keys on-prem. It must be ensured that all Data
            at Rest can be decrypted using keys protected by on-prem HSMs and that it is possible to revoke the access of the cloud provider to all key material.

            Using BYOK, the key material is generated and tested on-prem and exported to hardware-protected storage in the cloud. Keys are managed on-prem by the the organizations
            internal key management solution. For transport, the key must be encrypted and authenticated. Furthermore, it must be ensured that the exported key material is
            bound to its future use-case and location. Each key has a life-time defined by criticality and algorithm, clear roll-over processes must be defined and followed.
            <br><br>
            The required processes for BYOK are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creation / deletion of a key store</li>

        <h4>HYOK</h4>
        <p>
            Using Hold your own keys (HYOK) is preferable, as it gives the organization more control over the keys and enables easy potential migration between platforms. In particular,
            applications developed by the organization should not use CSP-specific vaults directly. In case a native CSP service integrates with the vault, a BYOK strategy is preferable,
            e.g. for Database as a Service and Kubernetes.
            <br><br>
            HYOK are best practice future state, although this is currently not supported by Microsoft Azure

        <h4>Key Management using Key Vault</h4>
        <p>
            Key Vault is a cloud-based, external key management system. It’s highly available and provides scalable, secure storage for RSA cryptographic keys, optionally backed by
            FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs). It doesn’t allow direct access to a stored key, but does provide services of encryption and decryption to
            authorized entities. Key Vault can generate the key, imported it, or have it transferred from an on-premises HSM device.
            <br><br>
            When you configure data encryption with a customer-managed key in Key Vault, continuous access to this key is required for the server to stay online. If the server loses
            access to the customer-managed key in Key Vault, the server begins denying all connections within 10 minutes. The server issues a corresponding error message, and changes
            the server state to Inaccessible. The only action allowed on a database in this state is deleting it.<br><br>
            After Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server is encrypted with a customer’s managed key stored in Key Vault, any newly created copy of the server is also encrypted.
            You can make this new copy either through a local or geo-restore operation, or through read replicas. However, the copy can be changed to reflect a new customer’s managed
            key for encryption. When the customer-managed key is changed, old backups of the server start using the latest key.<br><br>
            To avoid issues while setting up customer-managed data encryption during restore or read replica creation, it’s important to follow these steps on the master and restored/replica servers:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Initiate the restore or read replica creation process from the master Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server.</li>
                <li>Keep the newly created server (restored/replica) in an inaccessible state, because it’s unique identity hasn’t yet been given permissions to Key Vault.</li>
                <li>On the restored/replica server, revalidate the customer-managed key in the data encryption settings. This ensures that the newly created server is given wrap and unwrap permissions to the key stored in Key Vault.</li>

        <p> PostgreSQL service utilizes postgres built-in firewall mechanism using <code>ph_hba.conf</code> file. <br><br>
            Connections to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server are first routed through a regional gateway. The gateway has a publicly accessible IP, while the server
            IP addresses are protected. The following diagram illustrates the traffic flow:</p>
        <img src="media/net-security.png" width="700" height="300">
        <p>
            A newly created Azure Database for PostgreSQL server has a firewall that blocks all external connections. Though they reach the gateway, they are not allowed to
            connect to the server. <br><br>
            To begin using your server from another computer, you need to specify one or more server-level firewall rules to enable access to your server. Use the firewall rules
            to specify which IP address ranges from the Internet to allow. Access to the Azure portal website itself is not impacted by the firewall rules. <br><br>
            The example uses Access to Azure Services enabled or Public peering. This will be different for private link but gives some insight to how communications are proxied
            to Azure PAAS services.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Connecting from Azure</h4>
        <p>
            1. You should enable Azure Connections on your PostgreSQL firewall if the application connecting to your database is hosted in Azure.
               - For example, to host an Azure Web Apps application, or an application that runs in an Azure VM, or to connect from an Azure Data Factory data management gateway, the
                 resources do not need to be in the same Virtual Network (VNet) or Resource Group for the firewall rule to enable those connections.
               - When an Azure-hosted application attempts to connect to your database server, the firewall verifies that Azure connections are allowed.
               - This option configures the firewall to allow all connections from Azure including connections from the subscriptions of other customers. This can be controlled by
                 setting IP restrictions on the source IP of the firewall.
            <br><br>
            2. You should NOT enable Azure Connections on any PostgreSQL firewall if the application connecting to your database is hosted on-premise.
            <br><br>
            3. Other PAAS services connections into Azure PostgreSQL should be assessed individually for best practice secure configuration.

            Best practice is to disable all Azure service traffic to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server via the public endpoint by setting Allow Azure Services to OFF.<br><br>
            Ensure no public IP addresses or ranges are allowed to access the server either via NSG or PostgreSQL firewall rules, and no private IP addresses are allowed to
            connect to the Azure PostgreSQL server via virtual network service endpoints.<br><br>
            Create a Private Link to the Azure PostgreSQL server and only allow traffic to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server using the Private IP address of the VM.<br><br>
            With Private Link, you can now set up network access controls like NSGs to restrict access to the private endpoint.<br><br>
            Access to the Azure PostgreSQL server should be restricted to only the IPV4 addresses that are found in rules applied to both a) the NSG subnet where the Azure PostgreSQL
            server has a private endpoint and b) the Azure PostgreSQL firewall. This reduces data exfiltration risks.<br><br>
            With Private Link, you can enable cross-premises access to the private endpoint using Express Route (ER), Then you can subsequently disable all access via public endpoints.

            Read replicas can be created in either the same region as the master server or in a different region. Cross region replication helps in the DR set up.</br>
            The replicas don’t inherit the firewall rules or the service endpoint of the master server and therefore the rules must be set separately for the replica.</br>
            There is no automated fail-over between the master server and the replica. The fail-over process is manual and requires the replication to be stopped. Once the
            replication is stopped, the replica becomes stand-alone server. The replica server is then restarted, so it can accept writes.</br>
            The applications need to be pointed to the replica. A script that is capable of performing the above steps to stop replication and making the replica to a master
            server should be created to achieve this.</br>
            The Azure replication support parameter needs to be configured for replicas as this feature is dependent on Postgres WAL (Write Ahead Log). The parameter has 3 options
            viz. 'Off, 'Replica' and 'Logical'. This needs to be set to at-least 'Replica' for logging to be configured for replica servers.</br>

    <p>
        A 99.99% availability requirement is defined in the SLA document and handled by Microsoft. <br><br>
        Additionally, high availability can be implemented by creating a read-only replica of the database in a different region to the
        one the database is deployed in. A script can be used to fail-over between the main database and the read replica. If the replication
        is broken the read-replica becomes writeable and can act as the main database. This method ensures high availability between regions,
        on top of the high availability guaranteed by Microsoft.
